/**
 * This event is used to notify {@link PathwayElementListener}s of changes to properties of a PathwayElement.  
 * <p>
 * There are three variations on this event:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Only a single, known property may have changed, that is not a coordinate change.
 * <li>Only one of the coordinate properties (x, y, width, height) may have changed.
 * <li>Any property may have changed.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Variation 2 is introduced for performance reasons. Coordinate changes generate a lot of events (e.g. resizing or dragging an object) and
 * typically change in groups (if MLeft changes, MCenterX also changes). Listeners that are interested in coordinate changes, may filter out
 * changes to these properties by using the {@link #isCoordinateChange()} property. Listeners that are not interested in coordinate changes
 * may use the {@link #affectsProperty(Property)} method to find out if a property of interest may have changed.
