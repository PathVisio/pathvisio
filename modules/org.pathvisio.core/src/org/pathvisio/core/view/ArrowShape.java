/**
   ArrowShapes determine how the ending of a line can be drawn. These
   are arrows in a broad sense - they could be T-bars for example.
   <p>
   ArrowShapes have a fill type. FillType can be OPEN, CLOSED or WIRE.
   The fillType determines whether the body of the arrow head is filled
   with the foreground color or with the canvas color.
   <p>
   For the outline, the shape returned by getShape() will be used.
   getFillShape() optionally defines a different shape for the body. If there
   is no separate fillShape defined, the same shape is used for the outline
   and for the body.
